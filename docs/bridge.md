# Bridge

## Disclaimer

**Disclaimer: KoinDX Labs only provides the web UI interface for the bridge. The bridge is a decentralized protocol. KoinDX Labs does not operate the bridge. The bridge is also not audited at this point in time and bears a risk.**

## About

The bridge allows users to transfer assets between different blockchain networks. Currently, only Ethereum and Koinos blockchain are available in the bridge.

In short, the bridge works by creating a corresponding token on the target blockchain that represents the original token on the source blockchain. The original token is locked in a smart contract on the source blockchain, while the corresponding token is minted on the target blockchain. The two tokens are linked by a unique identifier, which ensures that they are always interchangeable at a 1:1 ratio.

## Redeem Functionality

Once the asset has been bridged, users can redeem the original token on the source blockchain by burning the corresponding token on the target blockchain. To redeem the original token, users need to follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Redeem" page on the KoinDX bridge web UI.
2. Select the source blockchain and the original token that you want to redeem.
3. Enter the amount of the corresponding token that you want to burn.
4. Submit the transaction and wait for the confirmation.

Once the transaction is confirmed, the corresponding token will be burned on the target blockchain, and the original token will be unlocked in the smart contract on the source blockchain. The original token can then be transferred or used on the source blockchain as usual.

By using the KoinDX bridge UI, users can transfer assets between different blockchains and take advantage of the unique features and functionalities offered by each blockchain network. However, it's important to note that the bridge is a decentralized protocol that is not audited at this point in time and bears a risk. Therefore, users should exercise caution when using the bridge and thoroughly research the risks and limitations involved.
