# Custom Tokens

## About

The default asset on Koindx during Koinos testnet right now is tKoin. 

Default assets are provided by lists from Koindx.com. If you have created your own token, or want to trade a token that we do not know about, you can also add a custom token.

We provided two example tokens **Token Demo A** and **Token Demo A** for the purpose of testing the dex functions.

The contracts of test tokens are the following:

- TKNA: 1M6NjRHh5x926wZUXYUz86x6j5MBqQJAvQ
- TKNB: 1H88naibGSwCbxnXB3MpYSdiEChKducag3

## How to add a custom token

Navigate to the swap or liquidity page of Koindx.

Click on the TKOIN / SELECT A TOKEN button in the input field.

![Button with address](/img/doc_img/swap.png)

After that you will see the "Select a Token" modal. 

Here all tokens that Koindx or you added are listed. You can choose one of these to swap for example.

If you want to select a custom token, you need to choose the Manage Tokens page below the listed assets.

Copy the contract address of Token Demo a into the address search field.

Now it should be found and you can click on it to import the asset.

We will show you a warning that we don't know the asset and that it might be a risk for you.

If you accept it and understand it, you can still import the asset.

Go back to the select a token page and you will see that Koindx now shows you the recently added "Token Demo A" Token.

You can use the custom token now everywhere on Kondx.com
