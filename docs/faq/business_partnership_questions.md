# Business / Partnerships Questions

## Listing an asset

The KoinDX protocols allow to trade every token that has allowances implemented. That means any user with liquidity can create trading pairs on KoinDX. Please take a look at the [liquidity](/protocol/liquidity) page to learn more about how to provide liquidity at KoinDX.

## How can I add my token to the default token list

We will only list selected assets to our default token list, which meet the necessary requirements.
If you want to request a listing on the default list, please submit [this application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCVocPYXL9QJ8UgDXI1Y0ZFRBxwrdoorXUrHuaPjB6w-ZZYA/viewform).
