## Slippage Tolerance

Slippage tolerance is the maximum price change you're willing to accept. The lower the liquidity of a token pair is the higher the price impact of your trade will be.

In some cases the slippage limit might to be adjusted to do the trade.

## Use KoinDX API

The toggle activates or deactivates the KoinDX API in your browser. If you deactive that KoinDX API, all the data you receive is requested from a Koinos node directly. You won't receive aggregated data from our backend service anymore.
