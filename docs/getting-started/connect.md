# Connect your wallet

## Wallets
If you are new to Koinos and you don't have a wallet yet, please read the following section.
There are two wallets available to use with KoinDX. Kondor and MKW.

- [Kondor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kondor/ghipkefkpgkladckmlmdnadmcchefhjl) (Chrome browser extension [Guide at Koinosforum](https://discourse.koinosforum.com/t/starting-with-kondor-wallet/143))
- [MKW](https://mykw.vercel.app) (Progressive web app)

If there are more questions feel free to ask for help in the [KoinDX Discord](https://discord.koindx.com) or [official Koinos Discord](https://discord.koinos.io) server.

## Connect the wallet
If you have a wallet set up and installed, you can connect it with the KoinDX dApp.

You can find the connect button in the upper right corner on every page.

Click the connect button and choose the wallet you want to use.

After you have pressed the button, your wallet will ask for permission to provide account data from your wallet.

Accept to proceed.

If everything worked out, the connect button should have changed. 
Now a button that displays the first and last five characters of your address should be visible.
