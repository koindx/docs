# Intro to KoinDX

Learn everything about **KoinDX**.

KoinDX can proudly say it's the first DEX on the [Koinos Blockchain](https://koinos.io?utm_source=koindx-docs).
KoinDX is a cutting-edge decentralized exchange that features an advanced Automated Market Maker (AMM) functionality and exciting Tokenomics. The project leverages the free gasfee Mana-system of the Koinos blockchain and creates a great trading experience. The decentralized protocols which build the core of KoinDX are governed by KoinDX DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization. These trading protocols allow users to conduct transactions without the need for a middleman. KoinDX also offers an exciting opportunity for users to earn rewards by staking sKOINDX and providing liquidity to the platform as a Liquidity Provider (LP). With KoinDX, you can enjoy the benefits of decentralized trading while earning passive income through staking and liquidity provision.
