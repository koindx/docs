# Treasury Earnings Distribution

![KOINDX token allocation](/img/doc_img/tokenomics/treasury_earnings.png)

The left diagram shows the distribution of LP-earnings and DAO-earnings.

In the diagram on the right side, you can see how the DAO will use the earnings.

40% of the earnings will be used to buy tokens back from the open market. These tokens will be sent to the staking contract.
