# Connect your wallet

If you have Kondor wallet installed setup and installed, connecting your wallet is very easy.

You can find the connect button in the upper right corner on every page.

Click the connect button and choose Kondor wallet as the type of wallet you want to use.

After you press it, Kondor wallet will ask you wether you allow koindx to read your address or not.

Choose accept to proceed.

If everything worked out, the connect button should have changed. 
Now an outlined button that displays the first and last five characters of your address should be visible.
