# AMM/Swap

This section explains to you what a swap is and how you do a swap on KoinDX.

## What is a swap?

A swap is a very simple way to trade assets on KoinDX.

On KoinDX you don't trade directly on a peer to peer basis with another KoinDX user directly. You will use our KoinDX Swap protocol instead.
The assets from you are traded with the liquidity pools which provide the exchangable token pairs.

This sounds much more complex than it is in reality. Learn how to swap assets on KoinDX in the next section.

## How do I swap assets on KoinDX?

If you want to swap an asset on KoinDX, navigate to the [swap page](https://koindx.com/swap).

Then you should connect your wallet if you haven't done this already. Check out the [connect page](../getting-started/connect.md) if you want to learn more about that.

After that you will see the "Select a Token" modal.

Here all tokens that KoinDX or you added are listed. You can choose one of these to swap for example.

Learn more about how to [add custom tokens here](../getting-started/custom_tokens.md).

If you have selected a trading pair, then you can begin to set the amount of the token you want to trade.

Adding a number will update the input field of the other token. You will see directly what you can receive for this trade. Notice also the slippage for your trade and also the number of the maximum send amount.

If everything looks good, you can click on Swap. A Kondor wallet window will open and ask you to sign the transaction.
After clicking on sign, your transaction will be processed.
