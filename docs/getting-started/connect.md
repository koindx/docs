## Connect your wallet to KoinDX

If you have a wallet set up and installed, you can connect it with the KoinDX dApp.
You can find the **connect button** in the upper right corner on every page.

Click the connect button. Read and accept the [terms of service](https://koindx.com/terms-of-use?utm_source=koindx-docs) and [privacy policy](https://koindx.com/privacy?utm_source=koindx-docs) if you want to proceed.

After that, you can choose the wallet you want to use.

When you have selected a wallet, you will be ask for permission to provide account data from your wallet.

Accept to proceed.

If connecting your wallet was successful, the connect button should have changed.
Instead of the connect button, an element which shows the first and last characters of your address should be visible.
