# Custom Tokens

## About

KoinDX, a decentralized exchange, offers the KOINDX token as its default asset. Additionally, KoinDX provides a list of default assets that don't require manual addition. However, if you want to trade a token that's not included in the default list, you can still add it to your selection.

## How to add a custom token

To add a custom token to your selection on KoinDX, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the swap or liquidity page of KoinDX.
2. Click on the asset name in the input field.
3. The "Select a Token" modal will appear, listing all default and custom-added tokens.
4. To select a custom token, choose the "Manage Tokens" button located below the listed assets.
5. In the "Manage Tokens" modal, copy the contract address of the token you want to add and paste it into the address search field.
6. If the token is found, click on it to import the asset.
7. A warning message will appear, notifying you that the token isn't part of the default asset list and adding it might pose a risk. If you accept the risk, click "import" to continue.
8. The custom token is now added to your selection and can be used throughout the KoinDX dApp.
