# Liquidity

## General

In a decentralized exchange like KoinDX, liquidity providing involves depositing funds into a liquidity pool for a particular token pair, such as KOIN and KOINDX. This liquidity pool is used to facilitate trades between buyers and sellers on the exchange.

When you deposit funds into the liquidity pool, you receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens in return. These LP tokens represent your share of the liquidity pool and can be redeemed for your portion of the trading fees earned by the pool.

For example, let's say you deposit 10,000 KOIN and 10,000 KOINDX into the KOIN/KOINDX liquidity pool on KoinDX. This gives you a 50% share of the total liquidity pool, which currently has a total value of 20,000 KOIN and 20,000 KOINDX.

If someone wants to trade 1,000 KOIN for KOINDX on KoinDX, the trade would be executed against the liquidity pool. This means that the trader's 1,000 KOIN would be swapped for an equivalent amount of KOINDX from the pool, and the trading fees for this transaction would be charged.

At KoinDX, the current swap fee is 0.25%, so in this example, the trading fee would be 2.5 KOIN. Of this fee, 0.17% or 1.7 KOIN is paid to the liquidity providers as an incentive, and 0.08% or 0.8 KOIN is retained by the protocol as earnings.

Since you own 50% of the liquidity pool, you would be entitled to half of the trading fees earned by the pool. In this case, your share of the trading fees would be 0.85 KOIN, which would be added to your holdings in the liquidity pool.

As more traders use the KOIN/KOINDX liquidity pool, the trading fees earned by the pool will increase, and your share of the fees will increase as well. However, it's important to note that the value of your LP tokens may fluctuate depending on the market conditions and the demand for the token pair.
